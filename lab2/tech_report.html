	<p>- this assignment took me 2 hours to be completely finished. </p>
	<p>- I used the element id for table, pictures and two headers of my page.(the id is #para1).</p>
	<p>- I used a global class for my paragraphs.</p>
	<p>- The HTML5 tags that I used are: details and dialog.</p>
    <p>- The CSS3 tags that I used are: clac(for calculating the width of the table) and transform (the transformed shape at the bottom of the page).</p>
